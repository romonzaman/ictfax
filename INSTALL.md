FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

SOURCE /usr/ictcore/db/database.sql;
SOURCE /usr/ictcore/db/email.sql;

```

Now update /usr/ictcore/etc/ictcore.conf and /usr/ictcore/etc/odbc.ini files as per above created database


4: ICTFax Installation

2. Download, ictfax source from github and extract it into some temp folder
3. from ictfax source move wwwroot folder as /usr/ictfax
```bash

```
4. again from ictfax source move ictpbx folder into /usr/ictfax/sites/all/modules
```bash
mv /tmp/ictfax/ictpbx /usr/ictfax/sites/all/modules
```
5. issue following command to create website configuration file
```bash
cp /usr/ictfax/sites/default/default.settings.php /usr/ictfax/sites/default/settings.php
chown -R apache:apache /usr/ictfax
```
6. Update Apache configurations to set /usr/ictfax as DocumentRoot
7. restart Apache

### 4.1 Frontend / Web GUI
1. Now visit http://DOMAIN.COM/ and follow the installation instructions for ICTFax (drupal based) front end installation.
2. When asked for database please provide access info to recently created database ( in ictcore section ) and enter `web_` as table prefix
2. Once you are done with installation, visit the website and login as site administrator with username and password that you provided during installation.
4. Now comeback to Web GUI and go to Modules menu and enable all modules in __ICTCore System__ Package.
5. Now you'll see menu item Fax Account, ICTCore System and others in your Navigation Menu.
6. After all please make sure that "Authenticated User" has permission over "Can use ICTFAX" from module permissions

### 4.2 User Synchronization
After installation issue following command against ictfax database, to synchronize ICTFAX users with ICTCore

```sql
USE ictfax;
INSERT INTO usr SELECT NULL, NULL, name, pass, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, mail, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(), 1, NULL, NULL FROM web_users WHERE uid > 0;
```

5: Email to FAX / FAX to Email service (optional)
=================================================
1. make sure that your desired domain's MX records are properly configured for email2fax server.
2. enable sendmail to listen on public ip address look for following line in /etc/mail/sendmail.mc
```conf
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')dnl
```
3. and change line mentioned above into
```conf
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp, Addr=0.0.0.0, Name=MTA')dnl
```
4. Add ictcore and apache to list of trusted user 
```bash
echo "ictcore" >> /etc/mail/trusted-users
echo "apache" >> /etc/mail/trusted-users
```
5. Add your domain name in allowed local domain list to let sendmail receive mails for that domain
```bash
echo "FAX_DOMAIN.COM" >> /etc/mail/local-host-names
```
6. route all mails for none-existing addresses into ictcore mailbox so we can receive emails for addresses like `xyz_number@FAX_DOMAIN.COM`
```bash
echo '@FAX_DOMAIN.COM ictcore' >> /etc/mail/virtusertable
```
7. to apply email related changes
```
/etc/mail/make
```
8. restart sendmail service so changes can take affect
```bash
chkconfig sendmail on
service sendmail restart
```
9. edit /usr/ictcore/etc/ictcore.conf and update __mailbox__ section like following
```ini
folder = /var/spool/email/ictcore
```

NOTE: make sure that `/etc/hosts.allow` is properly configured for accepting mails, and smtp `port (25)` is not blocked by firewall. if so execute following line to allow smtp port in firewall: 

```bash
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT    # smtp
/etc/init.d/iptables save
```
  
Now you are ready to send faxes through your email. See Admin/User Guide for further details.


6: First FAX
============

### 6.1: Sending First FAX
1. Login as admin

3. Currently, in ICTFAX3.0 only one gateway/trunk will be used for calling. Currently routing is not supported.
4. Register (Sign up) a new user by registering from http://DOMAIN.COM/ictfax/?q=user/register. Directly adding user from admin=>people is not supported. Once user is registered, it is blocked by default. Login in as admin and Activate it from admin=>People. (Sign up process can be changed from admin => configuration => Account settings. 
5. Logout
6. Login as newly created user
7. Send new fax via "FAX Account" => "Fax Outbox" => ""Create New FAX"
or via email2fax

NOTE: Attach only a single file. Every time create new email message and give unique email subject. 
Using Forward or Reply may confuse ictfax system with some previous email subjects.
